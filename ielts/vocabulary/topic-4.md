## Band 9 model essay
Water contamination is a serious form of pollution, and one that can be challenging to rectify. There seem to be two main causes involed, and a variety of damaging effects on people and **the biosphere**, which we will discuss here.

Probably the main factor is the issue of emissions from cars, factories and other human activities. These emissions contain damaging **pollutant particles** which can contaminate rainwater **run-off** and thus enter the **water cycle**, by transferring through the water table into **aquifers**, streams and rivers. **Filtration** and processing are not really viable options for such large volumes of water, and so the **water table** remains **tainted** with these elements over long periods, as we see in Eastern Europe today. In situations where **soil erosion** and **logging** have already damaged the local environment, the accumulation can be very serious. The other major cause is accidental or deliberate **dumping** of **waste** products in places outside of controlled **landfills** or **waste processing** centres. Even small amounts of abandoned waste can enter supplies through the ground, often undetected.

The effects on animal life can be severe, especially for species which are already endangered by such threats as **poaching**, **habitat loss** and food chain disription. Contaminated water can lead to **dwindling numbers** or even potential **extinction**, as may indeed happen to the Asian tiger populations. The impact on human society can also be distressing, including the poisoning of drinking water, famine or drought due to lack of safe **irrigation**, and long-term loss of land as we see, for example, after the Bhopal poisoning **catastrophe** in India. Such effects tend to have an especially grave impact on the very poorest in society, with the least resources to counter the environmental effects.

Overall, we see that emissions and dumping are the main origins of the problem, and that the effects on both humans and animals are **exacerbated** by the existing environmental, criminal or social problems.

## Explanation of the topic vocabulary and examples in Speaking
contamination = pollution by poisons or dangerous elements
- Ex: The atmosphere in large cities is often contaminated by smog, as we can see in China

the biosphere = the relationship between all living things on the planet
- Ex: Children should be educated on the biosphere through field trips and practical experiments.

emissions = gases entering the atmosphere
- Ex: Scientists spend their whole careers studying the effect of emissions on the climate.

pollutant particles = microscopic elements of pollution
- Ex: I remember going to a factory and seeing the snow covered with with pollutant perticles.

run-off = water that runs from the ground into rivers and lakes
- Ex: We should try to collect and use more run-off water, to avoid having to recycle water so much.

the water cycle = the natural process of water moving from clouds to rain and seas
- Ex: Scientists believe the water cycle is responsible for various natural events, expecially in coastal areas.

aquifers = underground, natural water stores
- Ex: My family have a well which connects to an aquifer, giving very pure water.

filtration = the process of filtering and removing impurities
