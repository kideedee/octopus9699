### Band 9 model essay
Nobody can deny that parental influence is important for children, at least in cases where children live with their parents, **foster parents** or **guardians**. However, it is by no means clear that children should spend time exclusively in the family, as we will see.

On the one hand, it may appear advisable for parents to act as **role models** and to establish **ground rules** for behaviour by spending as much time as possible with their children. This allows the youngsters to **absorb conventions** and **codes of conduct** which they can then follow themselves, hopefully leading to an absense of problems such as **bullying, truancy** and **delinquency** later on. Furthermore, being with the family should reduce the risk of children falling victim to crimes such as **abduction**, or coming under the influence of negative **peer pressure**.

On the other hand, we have to ask whether this is a practical proposition. In a society where many families are **dual-income**, or where one parent's role as **breadwinner** means he/she is away from the family for long periods, it is inevitable that children cannot spend all of their time with the family. **Child-minding** and **after-school childcare** are often used in these cases, and if manaed properly, these can be perfectly **viable** alternatives. Equally, is seems that children can in some cases learn a considerable amount from their **peers** in addition to adults, and allowing them to play without direct supervision may be a benifit.

To conclude, it appears that, while family time is essential for **bonding** and **absorbing patterns of behaviour**, there are definite advantages when children are outside the family too. This is provided that they are in a safe, well-behaved environment with peers who are themselves reasonably **well brought-up**

### Explanation of the topic vocabulary and examples in Speaking
foster parents = people who have children living in their existing family for a fixed period, with the original parents agreement
- Ex: Being a foster parent is a difficult and tiring role, I can imagine

guardians = people who are legally appointed to protect a child's interests in the absence of parents
- Ex: In some countries, the government appoints a guardian if the parents die or experience severe difficulties.

role models = people that children look to and respect as good examples
- Ex: In some countries, the royal family are good role models for youngsters, although in other cases this is not the case.

ground rules = basic rules governing the way people can behave in a situation.
- Ex: During the school holidays, my parents had strict ground rules for what we could do outside.

conventions = traditions or social norms that most people follow
- Ex: It's a convention for grandparents to live with their children in many countries.

codes of conduct = voluntary rules which people accept in a situation
- Ex: The Boy Scouts have a firm code of conduct, which seems to be a positive influence.

bullying = when children attack and intimidate other children
- Ex: Bullying could be reduced through better awareness and positive peer pressure in schools.

truancy = when a pupil leaves school without permission (verb = to play truant from school)
- Ex: I must confess that at secondary school I sometimes played truant and went to the park with my friends.

delinquency = minor crime (often by young people)

abduction = the crime of taking or kidnapping people for a criminal reason
- Ex: Child abduction is a great convern for many parents, especially in South America.

peer pressure = the pressure from people in the same group to act in a certain way

breadwinner = the person who earns all or most the money in a family.
- Ex: In some families, the father is still the only breadwinner.

child-minding = caring informally (not in schools) for children when parents are busy or working.
- Ex: In some countries, the state subsidises the costs of child-minding.

after-school childcare = caring for children in a school setting, as above
- Ex: Many families rely on after-school childcare because both parents work and commute.

viable = practical and possible to archieve
- Ex: It is not really viable to expect all children to get maximuum grades in exams.

peers = people in the same group or level as yourself.

- Ex: Unfortunately, some children absorb dangerous patterns of behaviour when watching movies or playing computer games.

well brought-up (to bring up children = to raise and educate them in your own moral, behavioural or religious conventions)
- Ex: I was brought up in a very religious family, and I seem to have absorbed their values.
