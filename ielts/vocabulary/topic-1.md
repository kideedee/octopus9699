# Band 9 Model Essay

Employers are always seeking ways to enhance their employees' **productivity**, and **subsidishing** healthy pursuits may be one way of achieving this. There are arguments on both sides, however, which we will discuss here.

On the one hand, it might be said that if workers are fitter and less stressed, their working time will be more efficient, leading to higher levels of **output** and service. Furthermore, the **work/life balance** of the staff will hopefully be improved, because their leisure time will be more fulfilling. This may even be more **motivating** than **pay increments, perks**, or **financial rewards** such as **bonuses** or **incentives** which may be hard to attain. Finally, feeling healthier may lead to better **job satisfaction** which is in itself a motivating factor.

Conversely, the problem with such leisure-based subsidies is that their efficacy is virtually impossible to quantify. For example, with **target-related** payments, employers can at least see whether the objectives are reached or not. It might also be said that, if this budget was spent on (for instance) **on the job training** or **day release programmers**, the employees would achieve better **career progression** and have better **job prospects**. These matters are all easier to **measure**, especially in **performance reviews** and **appraisals**, and may even help to reduce the risk of **redundancy** if the company **restructures, downsizes** or **outsources** its **workforce**.

Overall, it seems that, while health-related subsidies are **superficially** attractive, the lack of **measurability** is a substantial drawback. Spending funds on **ongoing training** would appear to be a better use of company or **Human Resources** budgets.

# Explanation of the topic vocabulary and examples in Speaking
**to subsidise** = to pay part of the cost of something, usually in order to help people
- Example: The government could encourage children to be healthier by subsidising swimming lessons and sports coaching at weekends

**perks** = reward from an employer which are not financial (eg. free lunches, a car, etc)
- Example: Personally, I'd like to work for a company that gives lots of perks, because I would find this very enjoyable.

**bonuses** = money given in addition to salary, usually in return for achieving targets
- Example: Apparently some investment bankers can earn millions of dollars in bonuses.

**incentives** = any reward that makes people work harder
- Example: Some employers offer vacations or parties as incentives if the team hits its sales targets.

**target-related** = dependent on hitting a target
- Example: My boss once offered me a target-related bonus, but it was almost impossible to achieve!

**day release programmes** = programmes of training or education when employees can spend entire days out of work
- Example: I feel that employers should be much more flexible regarding training, of example by subsidising day release programmes or job exchanges with other companies.

**superficial** = not addressing deep or important issues
- Example: I'm not a big fan of traditional music. I find the lyrics rather old-fashioned and superficial for modern listeners.
